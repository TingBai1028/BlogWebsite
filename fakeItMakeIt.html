            <h2>100%, YES</h2>
            <p>Just think about it, all actions comes from thoughts, isn't it?</p>

            <section>
                <h2>My story</h2>
                <p>I came from China, you all know education there is extreme and hard, I will describe it as "anti-human" and I hate it so much. As an international student myself, a beloved tutor used to ask me, why Chinese student so quiet? Well I answered "Maybe they are just shy". Deeply I know that is absolutely not the case. The culture made us this way. We don’t encourage an active student who are willing to share their thought. To be honest, we are not allowed and indeed don’t have any thought on things happened. We called it “The first bird”, which means when a bunch of bird flying, hunter always shot the first bird. As you can see, an active student, so called “The first bird” is a negative word in China and we don’t encourage that. That’s why all student keep quiet inside classroom and keep quiet through out their life.</p>
                <p>I don’t like being quiet. But I am also normal Chinese who don’t have too much dare to be the unique one. So I choose to fake, being a quiet person for 17 years. At the age of 18, I decided to go overseas, I came to a western country where being active is normal and encouraged. I know my goal, immigration, I need to be the top student, I need to do perfect on every part of the circle. So I decide to be the top student, fake it.</p>
                <p>I start talking in my classroom. My major have a lot of Chinese student, so the tutorial is as quiet as back in China, I am the only one talking and interact with tutor. It is awkward when you didn’t nail English, but I know I have to do it. When you awkward a hundred times, you will feeling nothing in the 101th, trust me, Fake it till you Make it.</p>
                <p>I am, indeed a “A student” now. I am not confident enough to call myself the top student, because I will never satisfied, greedy individual. When you start fake it as you are a good student, others start believe you, then to keep the “lie” going you need to put more effort to fake it, like a circle. Finally, at some point, you will find yourself a real, not fake. </p>
                <p>Break the theory into practical, what I want to say is Choose Your Persona. You are living in a real Minecraft world and you can add whatever magic you want on yourself. Trust me, build your persona. Persona, is when you enter a room, the vibe you bring in. For example, no matter what I wear, boots, leader jacket, or super-feminine dress, my vibe is always bossy and leadership. I know the way I talk is pretty aggressive, like your annoying boss. But anyway that is my persona and I am enjoy it.</p>
                <p>If you want to be a good student, pretend you are and start teaching your peers. If you want to be a successful funder, pretend you are and networking like you are a real future founder. If you want to be a musician, pretend you are really into music by start talking to your friend the music you love and share some high level stuff you got.</p>

                <h2>It is all coming from your thought.</h2>
                <p>I have a relative, typical Karen, annoying, I have to say. However this is nothing about me renting about her, leave it to another blog. What I notice is it is always thought comes first. She is a self-centered person, constantly blaming me about her house is not tidy, too much dirt and hair on the ground because of me, the pot I cleaned is still greasy, my bathroom have an odor coming from sweat that she cannot stand. Am I really this dirty? Dirty Girl? No, Not really.</p>
                <p>She have a period of those stuff. First, she will create a thought, like “Oh, I am a clean person, so I can’t bear there is a single hair on the ground, I WILL gone crazy.” Will she gone crazy when she saw a single hair on the floor? If she didn’t create the thought I would say no, no one being annoyed by a hair. Unfortunately, with the thought, it is like her belief, she set up her persona, which is “a clean person who cannot stand hair”. She choose to believe this is her, so she put it into action, which is make me suffering.</p>
                <p>What I want to say is, thought always comes first, and it is EASY to control, so easy. You are afraid public speaking? Think of who create the thought, and trick yourself into confident model. You are afraid making friend? Who is stopping you? Yourself. Change the thought, it is easy.</p>

                <h2>Tags that is not good for you, take it off.</h2>
                <p>I am a huge funs of MBTI and used to interested in zodiac sign. I had to say, I enjoy it because I didn’t know who I am, I need something to define me. My type is ESTJ, like I said before, the vibe I am showing off is bossy lady, which is part from me knowing my type is ESTJ, which is a bossy type. I enjoyed this persona so I decide to keep it. However I also notice I am pretty aggressive when talking to others, I used to enjoy it because my mates said my trolling is so funny. When I go into college, I meet more different kind of people, and my aggressive hurt people sometimes. Yes, I am trying to take it off. I still enjoy trolling people because I am good at it, but it is time to reduce the frequency because there is some sensitive person (like the Karen above). This is a journey I need to go, I know it is not easy but we will see.</p>
                <p>Have you ever say that “I am an introvert, I am afraid to talk to him”, “I am too shy to ask, maybe I just do it myself”, this what I am talking about, you are tagging yourself, and the tag is not good for you. Are you really shy? Are you really don’t have the dare to talk? I don’t think so, it is your thought stopping you. You are making a prison to yourself, don’t you see? You are not shy, you are just tagging yourself so that you can be comfortable forever. Take it off, the tag is not good for you, we are going to face it anyway.</p>
