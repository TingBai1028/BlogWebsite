                <h2>Recently fucked up </h2>
                <p>I was so annoyed by the emotion flow, some times I stay hyper-functioning, sometimes I want runaway from all my responsibilities, why it can't keep consistant? Now I don't want to do anything, I am tired and feeling guilty to rest at the same time.</p>
                <p>Social is so easy, yesterday I talked to two lady randomly, showed my kindness, but socail event? Hell nah. Why I keep refuse social event that I excatly needed but I hiding from it?</p>
                <p>I am good at tutoring but am I willing to do it? No, I hate it because even you told them the best solution and practices, they don't listen, they don't, then what is the point of me.</p>
                <p>I am good at entertaining but there just some person I can't entertain, why you so hard to be happy? Why you always want to make every thing so annoying? Why you always so self-centered and everyone need to do what you do? What exactly the point of all this?</p>
                <p>Greet, my mom and dad and grandma are having delicious dinner to celebrating lunar new year, what do I eat? Yammy delicious air. Great. It is not that I don't want to making something "yammy", it is when I start to do something, there is always someone finding something wrong with it. Why it is so hard to truly do what I love to do, eat what I want to eat?</p>
                <p>I don't have a good relationship with food start from 2024. I start binging when no one is at home. And I eat one meal a day, just lunch, when it is lunch, I will eat double food that I normal consume. Now I go out daily and almost all I eat is breakfast burrito, I messed up with my burrito, it is oily and smelly. Today I eat one beef burrito and a bottow of sugar. That's it. I don't like eat anything after I fucked up a interview. I just want to lie down, but no place for me to lie down. Today is 40 degree and there is no AC in my room, so after I fucked up I go back to uni like it is my only home. Guess what, the air here is extreme humid and my face is oily, my palm is greasy and stinky, my leg is almost stink to the chair. Great, best feeling ever.</p>
                <p>When people question myself like my intellengece, my logic, I will be mad, no matter what, at least I will be pissed. I am just like a dictactor in my whole fucking little world. Right, I always thinking I am so great and can't take that someone is better than me. They are just some more intellence people there with more opportunity, and I am not, I am talling myself this but do I really agree it deeply? No. I know deep in my heart I still think I am the one-in-hundred person who is rare. Such a baby, maybe the real self-centered person is me. But when I got some opportunity, I always want other people also take the chance. And indeed I did that. Now my sick comes again, right, so why no one do that for me? Why eveyone just asking and taking? See? I will be so self-centered when I helped someone, just like they are owing me everything.</p>
                <p>The whole job market is a joke. No one willing to give opportunity to potential. "Experience", does that gurantee anything? I don't think so. You know how you working experience goes, half a day scorling social media and doing nothing. Why they can't give away experience and bring back trust. Why is no one willing to give a basic trust to a person that someone can do a job well evne tho they are just a beginner? No one fucking know. This is a problem of this ages. Where is everyone's first job come from, all from their relatives? Please let the answer be no, please.</p>
